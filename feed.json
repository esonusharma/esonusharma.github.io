Check out our <strong>ultimate guide</strong> on WordPress hosting and make an informed decision!</p>\n<p>Time is running faster than you think. With time, WordPress has stood the evolution of the web. As a WordPress user, one of the challenges is to choose the <strong>Best WordPress hosting</strong> for yourself.</p>\n<p>In this article, we will explore a complete guide on <strong>WordPress hosting</strong>.</p>\n<p>This guide will help you to choose the right hosting according to your needs. The reason behind the complication is the different types of hosting currently available.</p>\n<p>There are currently multiple types of hosting types, including <strong>shared, VPS, managed</strong>, and <strong>free WordPress hosting</strong>. By the end of the guide, you will be able to distinguish between them. We will also go through top WordPress hosting and the things you should look into when choosing a hosting.</p>\n<p>Let’s get started.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Hosting: The Ultimate Guide</h2>\n<p>Before we move forward, let’s look at the things that you need to look into the hosting provider. These factors are essential, and you should always keep these in mind before making a proper WordPress hosting selection.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Requirements:</strong> The first thing that you need to check if the server has the proper requirements to run WordPress. This means that it needs to have PHP 7.3+, Apache with mod_rewrite, Nginx, and HTTPS support. If you are not sure, then it is always better to ask support to clear your confusion.</li>\n<li><strong>Pricing:</strong> The next thing that you need to check is pricing. Generally, there are tons of options when it comes to plans. Your choice should depend on your requirements and budget. Always try to find a balance between features, pricing, and performance. Also, make sure that the plans are transparent in what they are offering.</li>\n<li><strong>Speed:</strong> Speed is a critical part of any hosting. The better speeds you get, the faster your website will load. This means that you will provide a better user experience and also have a better chance to rank higher on Google.</li>\n<li><strong>Uptime:</strong> The hosting should provide at least 99.95% uptime. Anything below this is not acceptable.</li>\n<li><strong>Customer support:</strong> Maintaining a WordPress site is not easy, and that’s why having good customer support is important</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Apart from the above, it would help if you also looked out for 1-click installation. Almost every good WordPress hosting company has this option available. This will make it easy for you to create and manage a WordPress website.</p>\n<h2>Understanding WordPress Hosting Deeply</h2>\n<p>As we already mentioned, there are plenty of WordPress hosting types. Any WordPress hosting you choose needs to have essential three elements, i.e., security, speed, and reliability. Apart from this, you should always keep your requirements in mind. To let you make the right choice, let’s go through the different types of WordPress hosting below.</p>\n<h2>Free WordPress Hosting</h2>\n<p>WordPress is an open-source project. It is similar to free beer. If you decide to use WordPress, you need to get paid hosting. But, in reality, you can also get access to free web hosting. Many hosting providers give you hosting services <strong>free of cost</strong>.</p>\n<p>But, there is a catch with the service. Most of these services are given by small hosting providers to earn revenue. If you decide to host on their free service, they will use your site to host banners and ads. They might also put a link in the footer of your site.</p>\n<p><strong>Free WordPress hosting</strong> is generally <strong>not reliable</strong>. They do go down from time to time. The server speed is also not great, and your site would easily have high latency issues. You will also get no support whatsoever. In short, do not go for free WordPress hosting at any cost.</p>\n<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Only choose free WordPress hosting if you really have no budget, and need a place for your site before you get a paid hosting service.</p>\n<h2>Shared WordPress Hosting</h2>\n<p>One of the most popular WordPress hostings is <strong>shared WordPress hosting</strong>. In this type, you will get a hosting space on a shared server where resources will be shared among multiple users and sites. This is possibly the best way to get started with WordPress hosting.</p>\n<p>Shared hosting is <strong>cheap</strong> and provides you good enough speed and reliability. Some of the shared hostings do provide <strong>unlimited resources</strong>. In reality, it is more of a marketing tactic, as you truly do never get unlimited resources. Some restrictions are kept on each account. Until and unless you cross those limitations, you will do just fine. Once you cross those limitations, you will get notifications. The handling of those scenarios entirely depends on the hosting provider.</p>\n<p>As a user, you should always confirm the limitations before getting a shared WordPress hosting.</p>\n<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Shared hosting is best suited for businesses that are in the stage of growth and require cost-effective hosting without compromising too much speed and stability.</p>\n<h2>VPS WordPress Hosting</h2>\n<p>In this type of hosting, you will get a dedicated virtual space on the server. This means that the server you are getting is capable of handling more traffic and load. VPS stands for <strong>Virtual Private Server</strong>.</p>\n<p>VPS is kind of similar to Shared hosting where you still share server resources, but the technique here is good enough to improve over it. You can think of it as getting a dedicated server by paying an affordable amount of money. VPS hosting is refined to perform nicely. They load fast and can be configured according to your needs. This means if you need to run specific software or tool, you can do it with VPS and not shared hosting.</p>\n<p><strong>VPS WordPress hosting</strong> generally requires some technical knowledge to manage. However, you can also take a look at the managed VPS hosting that offers a good amount of tools for better self-management. In managed VPS hosting, the hosting provider also manages different aspects of the hosting.</p>\n<p><strong>Best for:</strong> VPS hosting is best suited for a mid-sized business that is going through a growth phase or is receiving heavy traffic.</p>\n<h2>Dedicated WordPress Hosting</h2>\n<p>The next type of hosting that we will discuss is the <strong>dedicated WordPress Hosting</strong>. If you plan to get the best possible hosting service, then you should go for dedicated WordPress hosting.</p>\n<p>In dedicated WordPress hosting, you get access to a full server and its resources. This gives you an immense capacity for scaling and configuration.</p>\n<p>Dedicated servers require good technical knowledge to manage.

marketing arena and becoming the most important aspect of <strong>content marketing</strong> and <strong>SEO</strong>.</p>\n<p>A <strong>social media plugin</strong> helps any content to become <strong>viral</strong> by offering features like <strong>social sharing buttons</strong> and <strong>social follow buttons</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Social sharing buttons</strong> placed near the

difficult to choose the best plugin from this large repository.</p>\n<p>This collection is aimed at making it easy to choose from the best available social media plugins.</p>\n<h2>How to choose the Best Social Media Plugin for WordPress?</h2>\n<p>The evaluation parameters can be performance and utility.</p>\n<p>Filling up all the empty space of your site with <strong>social media icons</strong> may degrade the user experience.</p>\n<p>So, it is wise to use only those social networks which are used in social media marketing for your niche.</p>\n<p>Also, if the plugin is too heavy, it will slow down your site and increase the response time.</p>\n<p>And if your site is slow, then it will be difficult to retain the user.</p>\n<p>Also, Google doesn’t like slow sites so it may bring down

social follow buttons, and displaying social counts for showing the popularity of your article.</p>\n<p>This may reduce the number of plugins needed.</p>\n<p>But it depends completely on your choice,

                "content_html":"<p>Step-by-Step easy to follow procedure to install Julia programming language on Ubuntu and other Linux based operating systems.</p>\n<p>I know how frustrated you are trying to successfully install the latest version of the Julia programming language on Linux.</p>\n<p>Installation of Julia is straight-forward in Windows, as you just have to double-click the downloaded exe file and follow the instructions.</p>\n<p>These are instructions for installation of Julia on Ubuntu but can be adapted on different Linux distributions such as Fedora etc.</p>\n<p>When we want to install the latest version of Julia on Linux distributions, there are no specific instructions.</p>\n<p>There is an easy way listed on some sites through a PPA available at <a href=\"https://launchpad.net/~staticfloat/+archive/ubuntu/juliareleases\">https://launchpad.net/~staticfloat/+archive/ubuntu/juliareleases</a>, which has some direct commands to be executed for installing Julia, but the version of the Julia you will get may not be the latest and also this is unsupported and untrusted as mentioned on the above link.</p>\n<p>If you try to install Julia from the “Ubuntu Software Centre” or “Synaptic Package Manager” or directly using the command “sudo apt-get install julia”, you are probably going to get a very old version of Julia.</p>\n<p>I also faced all these problems as I wanted to install an official, pure, untouched fresh copy of the latest version of Julia to learn and use it.</p>\n<p>So finally I embarked upon the hard way of getting the latest Julia stable release version installed on my Ubuntu laptop.</p>\n<p>Firstly, we have to download the latest released Julia version from the location “<a href=\"https://julialang.org/downloads/\">https://julialang.org/downloads/</a>”</p>\n<p>I used the “Generic Linux Binaries for x86” version. The choice between x86 and ARM depends on the processor of your machine. Also, choose between 32 bit and 64-bit versions based on the Operating system and processor you have on your machine.</p>\n<p>After download, you will get a compressed tar.gz archive having a name similar to “julia-0.6.2-linux-x86_64.tar.gz”. As the “julia-0.6.2-linux-x86_64.tar.gz” name suggests that I downloaded the Julia version 0.6.2 which is latest at the time of writing this article, generic Linux binaries i.e. this can be used for any Linux system including Ubuntu, Fedora, Centos and more, x86 system and 64-bit operating system.</p>\n<p>The names may differ. Adapt the names accordingly.</p>\n<p>Remember these are binaries, these don’t need to be installed as they can be directly used from the directory they are extracted.</p>\n<p>These instructions can be followed for getting Julia working on most of the Linux operating systems with little or no modifications, but I cannot guarantee the perfect result. Try it at your own risk.</p>\n<p>I am assuming that the downloaded file is in your Downloads directory of Ubuntu.</p>\n<p>Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the downloaded tar.gz file resides, in the present case the Downloads directory.</p>\n<p>The terminal when just opened will show</p>\n<pre><code> x@xpc:~$\n</code></pre>\n<p>where x should be replaced by your username and xpc should be replaced by your computer name</p>\n<p>Navigate to the Downloads directory using “cd Downloads” command on the terminal written as</p>\n<pre><code> x@xpc:~$ cd Downloads\n</code></pre>\n<p>and then press enter to get following terminal</p>\n<pre><code> x@xpc:~/Downloads$\n</code></pre>\n<p>Extract the tar.gz file using the command “tar -zxvf julia-0.6.2-linux-x86_64.tar.gz” as shown below</p>\n<pre><code> x@xpc:~/Downloads$ tar -zxvf julia-0.6.2-linux-x86_64.tar.gz\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now a directory with extracted contents will be generated in the same parent directory as of the compressed archive with a name similar to “julia-xxxxxxxxxx” where xxxxxxxxxx may be a combination of alphabets and numerals.</p>\n<p>This is the final directory you need to run the latest Julia version, no installation is needed.</p>\n<p>To run Julia, you can directly run using the Julia file in location “julia-xxxxxxxxxx/bin/julia” as discussed below</p>\n<p>Navigate to the bin directory in the extracted directory using the command “cd /Downloads/julia-xxxxxxxxxx/bin” as expressed below</p>\n<pre><code> x@xpc:~$ cd /Downloads/julia-xxxxxxxxxx/bin\n</code></pre>\n<p>The terminal will now be like</p>\n<pre><code> x@xpc:~/Downloads/julia-xxxxxxxxxx/bin$\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now run the command “./julia” to run Julia on the terminal as shown below</p>\n<pre><code> x@xpc:~/Downloads/julia-xxxxxxxxxx/bin$ ./julia\n</code></pre>\n<p>The terminal will now change to Julia as presented below.</p>\n<pre><code> julia&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>But the problem is that I have to navigate to the directory every-time to run Julia.</p>\n<p>Many people have discussed on the internet about defining the path and alias through very complex procedures and as I am not a hardcore computer geek, it was really difficult for me to understand.</p>\n<p>I came to know about making a soft-link.</p>\n<p>So I decided to make a soft-link to the Julia to run it directly from anywhere with a short command without navigating to the directory containing it.</p>\n<p>I always try to do things neatly, so I decided to keep the extracted directory named “julia-xxxxxxxxxx” in the “/opt” directory of my system as most of my important programs reside in that.</p>\n<p>You need superuser terminal to copy a file into the “/opt” directory.</p>\n<p>So I used the command “sudo su” and then provided the password to get the superuser privileges as expressed below</p>\n<pre><code> x@xpc:~$ sudo su\n [sudo] password for x:\n root@xpc:/home/x#\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now navigate to the directory presently containing the extracted directory as expressed below</p>\n<pre><code> root@xpc:/home/x# cd /Downloads/\n root@xpc:/home/x/Downloads#\n</code></pre>\n<p>Copy the directory using the command “cp -r julia-xxxxxxxxxx /opt” as shown below</p>\n<pre><code> root@xpc:/home/x/Downloads# cp -r julia-xxxxxxxxxx /opt\n</code></pre>\n<p>After the directory is copied to the destination, now we will make the soft-link in a directory which is in the system path so that the soft-link can be called from any location to run Julia.</p>\n<p>To find out the directories in the system PATH use command “echo $PATH”, you will get a list of paths of directories separated by a colon(:) such as “/usr/local/bin”. You can use any of them. I used “/usr/local/bin” for the soft-link.</p>\n<p>Navigate to the chosen folder</p>\n<pre><code> root@xpc:/home/x# cd /usr/local/bin\n</code></pre>\n<p>The terminal will become</p>\n<pre><code> root@xpc:/home/x/usr/local/bin#\n</code></pre>\n<p>Create the soft-link using the command “sudo ln -s /opt/julia-xxxxxxxxxx/bin/julia julia” as shown below</p>\n<pre><code> root@xpc:/home/x/usr/local/bin# sudo ln -s /opt/julia-xxxxxxxxxx/bin/julia julia\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now return to the normal user terminal using command “ctrl+D” at the empty terminal “root@xpc:/home/x/usr/local/bin#”.</p>\n<p>The terminal will become</p>\n<pre><code> x@xpc:~$\n</code></pre>\n<p>Type the newly made soft-link i.e. “julia” on the terminal as shown below</p>\n<pre><code> x@xpc:~$ julia\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is where the magic happens and you get this</p>\n<pre><code> julia&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"

Other links are nofollow.</p>\n<p>The profile links are now behind the login wall, so can’t be indexed by the search engines.</p>\n<p>But if you post articles in the community, the “Read Full Post” button link is dofollow.</p>\n<h2>Diigo (Dofollow)</h2>\n<p><strong>Diigo</strong> is a social bookmarking website.</p>\n<p>All the bookmark links in your Diigo account are dofollow. So don’t forget to add your blog post bookmarks in Diigo.</p>\n<h2>About.me (Update-Dofollow)</h2>\n<p><strong>About.me</strong> is a portfolio website.</p>\n<p>This needs a trick.</p>\n<p>All other links on the profile page are nofollow except the social links.</p>\n<p>So, choose any social network from social links menu and add your desired URL there to get a dofollow backlink.</p>\n<h2>Github (Update-Dofollow)</h2>\n<p><strong>Github</strong> is a popular website. It provides nofollow links in the profile section.</p>\n<p>You can get dofollow links from github.com in the issues section of repositories too.</p>\n<p>Create a new repository, you can use any name for the repository.</p>\n<p>You can specify your website URL in the URL field of the repository settings.</p>\n<h2>Microsoft (Update-Noindex)</h2>\n<p><strong>Page is noindex.</strong></p>\n<p>You won’t believe you can get a dofollow backlink immediately from a <strong>Domain Authority 100</strong> website for free.</p>\n<p>First, register a Microsoft account with any email id of yours, you can even use a Gmail account. If you already have a Microsoft account then skip this step.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Log in to your Microsoft account</li>\n<li>Go to answers.microsoft.com, and go to the profile section, and edit profile.</li>\n<li>Now you can write your anchor text in the Link Text box.</li>\n<li>Add your link in the Link URL box.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You got your <strong>dofollow link on DA 100 Microsoft</strong> website.</p>\n<h2>Blogadda (Update-Noindex)</h2>\n<p>You can add your website and RSS to <strong>blogadda.com</strong>.</p>\n<p>New posts from your blog will automatically list on this blog directory from the RSS link you give in the details after they accept your application.</p>\n<h2>Alltop (Update-Nofollow)</h2>\n<p>You can add your own feed to your account which is visible on your public page but the page has a canonical tag to homepage of Alltop, so the backlinks have no value from SEO consideration, and content is also not syndicated to the homepage of alltop, so no use.</p>\n<p>Alltop is an extremely top quality directory, and RSS aggregation site.</p>\n<p>Create an account on it, and add the RSS of your blog to your profile.</p>\n<p>Heading of the RSS will be nofollow link to your blog but the blog posts below the heading will only be a cache link.</p>\n<p>There is no “meta robots index or noindex” tag there on the link page. So it seems that the page is indexable but not sure about some other way to block the indexing.</p>\n<h2>Torial (Update-Nofollow)</h2>\n<p><strong>Torial</strong> is a journalism and portfolio website.</p>\n<p>You can add your website RSS to your torial account. The Read more button links to your blog post and it is <code>&lt;s&gt;</code>dofollow<code>&lt;/s&gt;</code> nofollow.</p>\n<h2>Rank #1 with High Authority Social Bookmarking Sites</h2>\n<p>Social Bookmarking Sites include <strong>social networking sites, bookmarking sites, micro-blogging sites</strong>, etc.</p>\n<p>You can share your full blog posts, a summary of your blog posts, RSS feed of your blog, and even just link to your blog posts on such websites.</p>\n<p><strong>Social Bookmarking</strong> helps your content get found and indexed very fast by search engines. Most of these social bookmarking sites are High PR and High DA.</p>\n<p>The Internet is always changing and with the course of time, the dofollow status of some of these websites can change.</p>\n<p>But let me tell you that nofollow links are also important as they surely can drive an insane amount of traffic to your site.</p>\n<p><strong>Social Bookmarking Sites:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create backlinks which are mostly <strong>no-follow</strong> backlinks but still valuable.</li>\n<li>Increase the reach of the post to a large number of audience.</li>\n<li>Brings traffic to your post in the initial phase of publishing when search rankings for <strong>higher traffic keywords</strong> are not achieved.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of the websites take your <strong>RSS feed</strong> as input so that they always show links to some of your latest blog posts and hence make it easy for you to share and forget as once the RSS link is submitted, the links to new blog posts are automatically created in these websites without you bothering to make them again and again.</p>\n<p>The sharing of your latest blog posts to most of non-RSS submission-based social sharing sites can easily be automated using <strong>social automation tools</strong>.</p>\n<p>Some of the most popular and high authority social bookmarking sites are listed

effective and easiest method of <strong>Link Building.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Dofollow Comment Blogs</strong> offer a opprtunity for <strong>creating quality backlinks</strong> just by reading their articles and providing meaningful comments.</p>\n<p>Most of these <strong>High Quality Backlink</strong> sources are moderated, so comment responsibly, as spammy behaviour can lead you to a permanent ban to that blog.</p>\n<p>Don’t use automatic <strong>Link Building</strong> softwares and services as sooner or later they are going to land you in a <strong>Google Penalty</strong>.</p>\n<p>Also <strong>make backlinks</strong> in a scalable fashion to look natural to <strong>Google</strong>.</p>\n<p>Also, look for sites that use <strong>Commentluv</strong> plugin, it means you can promote your blog posts and at the same time get a dofollow backlink to your site and blog post.</p>\n<h2>Are directory listings still relevant?</h2>\n<p><strong>Dofollow Directories</strong> are my favorite as you just have to register to these and fill up your blog URL and RSS link.</p>\n<p>Most of these directories pull your RSS and thus giving out a <strong>dofollow backlink</strong> to all your listed articles.</p>\n<p>It works hands free as your content is shared and promoted automatically and you don’t have to do it manually for each article you write.</p>\n<h2>List of High Domain

to Get Backlinks</h2>\n<p>How to <strong>Get Backlinks</strong> is a common question asked by many beginners and bloggers. I know what are you going through now because I was also there once.</p>\n<p>Backlinks or inbound links are important for a website to get higher authority and rank higher in the search rankings. Only good quality links help in achieving the goal.</p>\n<p>According to Wikipedia, a backlink is also termed as incoming link, inbound link, inlink, inward link, and citation.</p>\n<p>The best way to create quality backlinks is to create them manually as it may take ages to get them naturally.</p>\n<p>Backlinking is a time-consuming and tedious process. But the hard work pays off. I have built backlinks to my blog using these methods.</p>\n<p>The shortcut ways of backlinking may end up in a penalty. The most dangerous method of building inbound links is by using automatic software.</p>\n<p>Building backlinks too aggressively also hurt the SEO process. Remember Google has to roll out just one update to penalize those using these methods.</p>\n<p>When a new Google update rolls out, many businesses that use dubious methods go out of business.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that a way of making shady backlinks is not in the blacklist of the search engines today but the very moment search engines came to know about such methods, they carry out an update to curb these malpractices.</p>\n<p>The methods discussed below are the best practices to make inbound links in the safest possible way.</p>\n<p>But don’t overdo anything, as search engines love <strong>natural backlinks</strong>. In link building, slow and steady still wins the race.</p>\n<h2>Safe Backlinking Strategy</h2>\n<p>Google considers over <strong>200+ factors</strong> while ranking a webpage for a particular keyword.</p>\n<p>But <strong>Inbound Links</strong> or Backlinks are most influential in this process. I observed this while building backlinks for my blog.</p>\n<p>The key points I took care of and you have to, while backlinking are listed below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Firstly, keep patience, it will take time to get the results.</li>\n<li>In creating high-quality backlinks, slow is better.</li>\n<li>Don’t buy backlinks from anybody, no matter how trustworthy the seller and the website is.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You have to create a lot of accounts on various websites, so choose a dedicated email address for creating and verifying these accounts.</p>\n<p>Remember, most of the websites only accept email ids of well-known email services like Gmail, Microsoft, and Yahoo, and not your branded email id like <a href=\"mailto:yourname@yourwebsite.com\">yourname@yourwebsite.com</a>.</p>\n<p>As the internet is ever-changing, many websites shut down daily. It is very difficult for us to check the status of the websites listed here on a regular basis, so we don’t assure that all links are working. We are human and errors are inevitable. If any of our readers found any discrepancies and dead links, please share your findings and suggestions through comments.</p>\n<h2>Commentluv</h2>\n<p><strong>Commentluv</strong> is a WordPress plugin, used by various bloggers to attract visitors to their blogs.</p>\n<p>The plugin enables the visitors to get a backlink to one of their own blog posts, thus becoming a good source to start the backlinking process to your blog posts.</p>\n<p>Read the articles completely and carefully, and give useful comments as these comments are mostly moderated to keep the spam in control.</p>\n<p>This method is beneficial for both the blog owner and the commenter, as the blog owner gets loyal visitors and commenters get a backlink.</p>\n<p>But sometimes commentluv links are not so effective, as some blog owners using commentluv plugin do not limit the number of comments on a particular blog post which leads to a number of outgoing links on a single page which downgrades the quality of backlinks.</p>\n<p>Too many comment links may look unnatural to search engines, so don’t go too far in building these.</p>\n<p>Don’t create these links too fast, keep it low-key.</p>\n<p>Try to get these links for different posts on your blogs from different commentluv blogs.</p>\n<h2>Guest Blogging</h2>\n<p><strong>Guest blogging</strong> is a very good white hat method of creating inbound links if used correctly.</p>\n<p>If you create guest articles on high-quality <strong>niche blogs</strong> with your relevant blog post links in the article itself and in the author bio section, it will give you strong high-quality backlinks as well as bring targeted traffic to your blog.</p>\n<p>It is a difficult task to convince the bloggers to publish your guest post on their blogs. Firstly you should build a relationship with the targeted bloggers on their blogs by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reading and commenting on the blog posts.</li>\n<li>Actively following them on social networks.</li>\n<li>Signing up for the newsletter.</li>\n<li>Replying back suitably to their emails.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In short becoming their loyal followers which will, in fact, enrich your knowledge too.</p>\n<p>After completing these tasks, pitch your article to the blogger. If your article is good, the blogger will accept the article.</p>\n<p>Don’t try to pitch a substandard article, just write a fresh, unique, good quality article of a relevant niche with at least 800 words.</p>\n<h2>Broken Links</h2>\n<p>The Internet is huge. A lot of content pops daily and a lot disappears daily.</p>\n<p>Articles contain links to pages, if those pages vanish, the links to these pages go broken and that is a bad experience for the readers.</p>\n<p>Bloggers do not want these broken links in their articles.</p>\n<p>But many bloggers have a lot of articles in their blogs containing a lot of links.</p>\n<p>It is almost impossible for these busy bloggers to keep track of all the links.</p>\n<p>If you find broken links in their articles and suggest them suitable replacement links of a similar type as a loyal reader, you can gain a backlink by slipping a link to one of your blog posts as a replacement.</p>\n<h2>Testimonials</h2>\n<p>You can get a backlink from the high authority websites whose products you buy and use by offering a <strong>testimonial</strong> to their product on their website.</p>\n<p>Most sellers like to showcase testimonials to their products to attract potential buyers.</p>\n<p>This is a win-win situation for both.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, these sellers also sweeten the deal by giving away free products, services, and support to the testimonial provider along with the backlink.</p>\n<p>All these methods discussed here are manual, slow, and tedious but in the long-term give a strong foundation to your blog without compromising its quality index in search engines.</p>\n<p>Now, I am going to compile a list of Backlinking opportunities.</p>\n<p>The Backlink sources can be a <strong>mix of profile backlinks, comment backlinks, commentluv backlinks, directory backlinks, forum backlinks, .gov backlinks, .org backlinks, .edu backlinks,</strong> and many more.</p>\n<p>Try to get backlinks from these websites in any possible way as it will boost your search rankings manifold.</p>\n<p>Also, remember to make backlinks to all your articles and not all of them just to the homepage or any single post.</p>\n"
