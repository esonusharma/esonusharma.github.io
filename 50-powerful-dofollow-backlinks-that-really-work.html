                <p>Dofollow Sites like blogs, websites, and directories allow <strong>dofollow backlinks</strong> to other websites.</p>
<p>A natural and strong <strong>backlink profile</strong> can help your content rank higher in search engines.</p>
<p>But it is very difficult to get such valuable links, especially from <strong>High DA</strong> Sites.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the internet is ever-changing, many websites shutdown daily. It is very difficult for us to check the status of the websites listed here on regular basis, so we don’t assure that all links are working or dofollow/nofollow/ugc. We are human and errors are inevitable. If any of our readers found any discrepancies and dead links, please share your findings and suggestions through comments.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><strong>Why dofollow backlinks matter?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Creating dofollow backlinks</strong> with a white-hat method from high domain authority niche sites increases the <strong>domain authority</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>powerful dofollow backlinks</strong> give <strong>link juice</strong> to your blog, adding to the <strong>Domain Authority</strong> of your website.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, keep in mind that even if you get a backlink from a web page, if the page is noindex or canonical is different from the URL itself, or link is ugc/nofollow then it will be of no SEO value for you.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><strong>What is a dofollow backlink?</strong></h2>
<p>A <strong>Dofollow Backlink</strong> looks like this in HTML:</p>
<pre><code> &lt;a href=&quot;https://esonusharma.github.io/dofollow-backlinks.html&quot;&gt;Dofollow Backlink&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>A Nofollow Backlink looks like this in HTML:</p>
<pre><code> &lt;a href=&quot;https://esonusharma.github.io/dofollow-backlinks.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Nofollow Backlink&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>A couple of more types like <strong>rel=”sponsored”</strong> and <strong>rel=”ugc”</strong> are explained in detail <a href="https://moz.com/blog/nofollow-sponsored-ugc">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Link Building</strong> is a tedious process, but the hard work pays off in the long-term.</p>
<p>A handful of strong dofollow backlinks from high authority sites like <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/">Entrepreneur</a>, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/">HuffingtonPost</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com">Forbes</a>, <a href="https://www.inc.com/">Inc</a>, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/">BusinessInsider</a> can dramatically slingshot your content to the top of the food chain.</p>
<h2>How to Make Dofollow Backlinks?</h2>
<p>The answer is simple, when you have a new website or blog, be slow and steady, get dofollow backlinks from <strong>high page rank</strong> URLs.</p>
<h2>Is it that simple to ask an established publisher for a backlink?</h2>
<p>No, its not easy as popular publishers would not link to you when you are new.</p>
<p>Also, even if you pay to get backlinks from others or hire an agency to buy backlinks, most of backlinks may not be of the quality you desire.</p>
<p>Sometimes, by using unfair practices to get backlinks according to Google Policies, if Google notices this can lead you into trouble and penalize your website.</p>
<h2>So, how to get the ranking dice rolling?</h2>
<p>You can hire a <a href="https://esonusharma.github.io/services">best trustable seo service</a> which can use <strong>white-hat</strong> methods for <strong>organic growth</strong> of your backlink profile.</p>
<p>Or you can build them on your own, if you have patience, time and expertise.</p>
<p>And I can tell you with my experience that for <strong>low competition keywords</strong> or long-tail keywords it is easier to rank if you go by rule.</p>
<p>I am now compiling a list of such <strong>High-Quality</strong> Backlinks Sources that offer Dofollow Backlinks.</p>
<p>Some of the following sites let you add “<a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/anchor-text">anchor text</a>” of your choice, some not, but either way a dofollow backlink from these sites will help.</p>
<p>Internet is ever changing and we don’t have the resources to check all the following links regularly, so if you find that any of them are not working or provide a nofollow or other non useful links, you can tell us in the comments.</p>
<p>Beware of the people selling High Domain Authority boost in very few days like <a href="https://www.peopleperhour.com/hourlie/increase-domain-authority-to-50-in-14-days/660603">this one</a> as the method will increase Domain Authority metric of <a href="https://moz.com">Moz</a> but have no actual authority boost in Google Search.</p>
<h2>HandPicked Dofollow Backlinks Sources</h2>
<h2>GrowthHackers (Dofollow)</h2>
<p>GrowthHackers is a popular community and allows dofollow backlinks for your website and social pages or profiles on your <strong>GrowthHacker.com</strong> profile. Other links are nofollow.</p>
<p>The profile links are now behind the login wall, so can’t be indexed by the search engines.</p>
<p>But if you post articles in the community, the “Read Full Post” button link is dofollow.</p>
<h2>Diigo (Dofollow)</h2>
<p><strong>Diigo</strong> is a social bookmarking website.</p>
<p>All the bookmark links in your Diigo account are dofollow. So don’t forget to add your blog post bookmarks in Diigo.</p>
<h2>About.me (Update-Dofollow)</h2>
<p><strong>About.me</strong> is a portfolio website.</p>
<p>This needs a trick.</p>
<p>All other links on the profile page are nofollow except the social links.</p>
<p>So, choose any social network from social links menu and add your desired URL there to get a dofollow backlink.</p>
<h2>Github (Update-Dofollow)</h2>
<p><strong>Github</strong> is a popular website. It provides nofollow links in the profile section.</p>
<p>You can get dofollow links from github.com in the issues section of repositories too.</p>
<p>Create a new repository, you can use any name for the repository.</p>
<p>You can specify your website URL in the URL field of the repository settings.</p>
<h2>Microsoft (Update-Noindex)</h2>
<p><strong>Page is noindex.</strong></p>
<p>You won’t believe you can get a dofollow backlink immediately from a <strong>Domain Authority 100</strong> website for free.</p>
<p>First, register a Microsoft account with any email id of yours, you can even use a Gmail account. If you already have a Microsoft account then skip this step.</p>
<ul>
<li>Log in to your Microsoft account</li>
<li>Go to answers.microsoft.com, and go to the profile section, and edit profile.</li>
<li>Now you can write your anchor text in the Link Text box.</li>
<li>Add your link in the Link URL box.</li>
</ul>
<p>You got your <strong>dofollow link on DA 100 Microsoft</strong> website.</p>
<h2>Blogadda (Update-Noindex)</h2>
<p>You can add your website and RSS to <strong>blogadda.com</strong>.</p>
<p>New posts from your blog will automatically list on this blog directory from the RSS link you give in the details after they accept your application.</p>
<h2>Alltop (Update-Nofollow)</h2>
<p>You can add your own feed to your account which is visible on your public page but the page has a canonical tag to homepage of Alltop, so the backlinks have no value from SEO consideration, and content is also not syndicated to the homepage of alltop, so no use.</p>
<p>Alltop is an extremely top quality directory, and RSS aggregation site.</p>
<p>Create an account on it, and add the RSS of your blog to your profile.</p>
<p>Heading of the RSS will be nofollow link to your blog but the blog posts below the heading will only be a cache link.</p>
<p>There is no “meta robots index or noindex” tag there on the link page. So it seems that the page is indexable but not sure about some other way to block the indexing.</p>
<h2>Torial (Update-Nofollow)</h2>
<p><strong>Torial</strong> is a journalism and portfolio website.</p>
<p>You can add your website RSS to your torial account. The Read more button links to your blog post and it is <code>&lt;s&gt;</code>dofollow<code>&lt;/s&gt;</code> nofollow.</p>
<h2>Rank #1 with High Authority Social Bookmarking Sites</h2>
<p>Social Bookmarking Sites include <strong>social networking sites, bookmarking sites, micro-blogging sites</strong>, etc.</p>
<p>You can share your full blog posts, a summary of your blog posts, RSS feed of your blog, and even just link to your blog posts on such websites.</p>
<p><strong>Social Bookmarking</strong> helps your content get found and indexed very fast by search engines. Most of these social bookmarking sites are High PR and High DA.</p>
<p>The Internet is always changing and with the course of time, the dofollow status of some of these websites can change.</p>
<p>But let me tell you that nofollow links are also important as they surely can drive an insane amount of traffic to your site.</p>
<p><strong>Social Bookmarking Sites:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create backlinks which are mostly <strong>no-follow</strong> backlinks but still valuable.</li>
<li>Increase the reach of the post to a large number of audience.</li>
<li>Brings traffic to your post in the initial phase of publishing when search rankings for <strong>higher traffic keywords</strong> are not achieved.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the websites take your <strong>RSS feed</strong> as input so that they always show links to some of your latest blog posts and hence make it easy for you to share and forget as once the RSS link is submitted, the links to new blog posts are automatically created in these websites without you bothering to make them again and again.</p>
<p>The sharing of your latest blog posts to most of non-RSS submission-based social sharing sites can easily be automated using <strong>social automation tools</strong>.</p>
<p>Some of the most popular and high authority social bookmarking sites are listed below:</p>

<h2>What about backlinks from blog comments?</h2>
<p><strong>Blog Commenting</strong> is still an effective and easiest method of <strong>Link Building.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dofollow Comment Blogs</strong> offer a opprtunity for <strong>creating quality backlinks</strong> just by reading their articles and providing meaningful comments.</p>
<p>Most of these <strong>High Quality Backlink</strong> sources are moderated, so comment responsibly, as spammy behaviour can lead you to a permanent ban to that blog.</p>
<p>Don’t use automatic <strong>Link Building</strong> softwares and services as sooner or later they are going to land you in a <strong>Google Penalty</strong>.</p>
<p>Also <strong>make backlinks</strong> in a scalable fashion to look natural to <strong>Google</strong>.</p>
<p>Also, look for sites that use <strong>Commentluv</strong> plugin, it means you can promote your blog posts and at the same time get a dofollow backlink to your site and blog post.</p>
<h2>Are directory listings still relevant?</h2>
<p><strong>Dofollow Directories</strong> are my favorite as you just have to register to these and fill up your blog URL and RSS link.</p>
<p>Most of these directories pull your RSS and thus giving out a <strong>dofollow backlink</strong> to all your listed articles.</p>
<p>It works hands free as your content is shared and promoted automatically and you don’t have to do it manually for each article you write.</p>

<h2>Beginner Strategy to Get Backlinks</h2>
<p>How to <strong>Get Backlinks</strong> is a common question asked by many beginners and bloggers. I know what are you going through now because I was also there once.</p>
<p>Backlinks or inbound links are important for a website to get higher authority and rank higher in the search rankings. Only good quality links help in achieving the goal.</p>
<p>According to Wikipedia, a backlink is also termed as incoming link, inbound link, inlink, inward link, and citation.</p>
<p>The best way to create quality backlinks is to create them manually as it may take ages to get them naturally.</p>
<p>Backlinking is a time-consuming and tedious process. But the hard work pays off. I have built backlinks to my blog using these methods.</p>
<p>The shortcut ways of backlinking may end up in a penalty. The most dangerous method of building inbound links is by using automatic software.</p>
<p>Building backlinks too aggressively also hurt the SEO process. Remember Google has to roll out just one update to penalize those using these methods.</p>
<p>When a new Google update rolls out, many businesses that use dubious methods go out of business.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that a way of making shady backlinks is not in the blacklist of the search engines today but the very moment search engines came to know about such methods, they carry out an update to curb these malpractices.</p>
<p>The methods discussed below are the best practices to make inbound links in the safest possible way.</p>
<p>But don’t overdo anything, as search engines love <strong>natural backlinks</strong>. In link building, slow and steady still wins the race.</p>
<h2>Safe Backlinking Strategy</h2>
<p>Google considers over <strong>200+ factors</strong> while ranking a webpage for a particular keyword.</p>
<p>But <strong>Inbound Links</strong> or Backlinks are most influential in this process. I observed this while building backlinks for my blog.</p>
<p>The key points I took care of and you have to, while backlinking are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, keep patience, it will take time to get the results.</li>
<li>In creating high-quality backlinks, slow is better.</li>
<li>Don’t buy backlinks from anybody, no matter how trustworthy the seller and the website is.</li>
</ul>
<p>You have to create a lot of accounts on various websites, so choose a dedicated email address for creating and verifying these accounts.</p>
<p>Remember, most of the websites only accept email ids of well-known email services like Gmail, Microsoft, and Yahoo, and not your branded email id like <a href="mailto:yourname@yourwebsite.com">yourname@yourwebsite.com</a>.</p>
<p>As the internet is ever-changing, many websites shut down daily. It is very difficult for us to check the status of the websites listed here on a regular basis, so we don’t assure that all links are working. We are human and errors are inevitable. If any of our readers found any discrepancies and dead links, please share your findings and suggestions through comments.</p>
<h2>Commentluv</h2>
<p><strong>Commentluv</strong> is a WordPress plugin, used by various bloggers to attract visitors to their blogs.</p>
<p>The plugin enables the visitors to get a backlink to one of their own blog posts, thus becoming a good source to start the backlinking process to your blog posts.</p>
<p>Read the articles completely and carefully, and give useful comments as these comments are mostly moderated to keep the spam in control.</p>
<p>This method is beneficial for both the blog owner and the commenter, as the blog owner gets loyal visitors and commenters get a backlink.</p>
<p>But sometimes commentluv links are not so effective, as some blog owners using commentluv plugin do not limit the number of comments on a particular blog post which leads to a number of outgoing links on a single page which downgrades the quality of backlinks.</p>
<p>Too many comment links may look unnatural to search engines, so don’t go too far in building these.</p>
<p>Don’t create these links too fast, keep it low-key.</p>
<p>Try to get these links for different posts on your blogs from different commentluv blogs.</p>
<h2>Guest Blogging</h2>
<p><strong>Guest blogging</strong> is a very good white hat method of creating inbound links if used correctly.</p>
<p>If you create guest articles on high-quality <strong>niche blogs</strong> with your relevant blog post links in the article itself and in the author bio section, it will give you strong high-quality backlinks as well as bring targeted traffic to your blog.</p>
<p>It is a difficult task to convince the bloggers to publish your guest post on their blogs. Firstly you should build a relationship with the targeted bloggers on their blogs by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading and commenting on the blog posts.</li>
<li>Actively following them on social networks.</li>
<li>Signing up for the newsletter.</li>
<li>Replying back suitably to their emails.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short becoming their loyal followers which will, in fact, enrich your knowledge too.</p>
<p>After completing these tasks, pitch your article to the blogger. If your article is good, the blogger will accept the article.</p>
<p>Don’t try to pitch a substandard article, just write a fresh, unique, good quality article of a relevant niche with at least 800 words.</p>
<h2>Broken Links</h2>
<p>The Internet is huge. A lot of content pops daily and a lot disappears daily.</p>
<p>Articles contain links to pages, if those pages vanish, the links to these pages go broken and that is a bad experience for the readers.</p>
<p>Bloggers do not want these broken links in their articles.</p>
<p>But many bloggers have a lot of articles in their blogs containing a lot of links.</p>
<p>It is almost impossible for these busy bloggers to keep track of all the links.</p>
<p>If you find broken links in their articles and suggest them suitable replacement links of a similar type as a loyal reader, you can gain a backlink by slipping a link to one of your blog posts as a replacement.</p>
<h2>Testimonials</h2>
<p>You can get a backlink from the high authority websites whose products you buy and use by offering a <strong>testimonial</strong> to their product on their website.</p>
<p>Most sellers like to showcase testimonials to their products to attract potential buyers.</p>
<p>This is a win-win situation for both.</p>
<p>Sometimes, these sellers also sweeten the deal by giving away free products, services, and support to the testimonial provider along with the backlink.</p>
<p>All these methods discussed here are manual, slow, and tedious but in the long-term give a strong foundation to your blog without compromising its quality index in search engines.</p>
<p>Now, I am going to compile a list of Backlinking opportunities.</p>
<p>The Backlink sources can be a <strong>mix of profile backlinks, comment backlinks, commentluv backlinks, directory backlinks, forum backlinks, .gov backlinks, .org backlinks, .edu backlinks,</strong> and many more.</p>
<p>Try to get backlinks from these websites in any possible way as it will boost your search rankings manifold.</p>
<p>Also, remember to make backlinks to all your articles and not all of them just to the homepage or any single post.</p>
