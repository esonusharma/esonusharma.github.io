### APG Details
#### 24MEC0505 Computational Fluid Dynamics and Heat Transfer 4 3-0-2
This course explores advanced concepts in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Heat Transfer. Topics include numerical methods for solving fluid flow and heat transfer equations, turbulence modeling, boundary layer analysis, and heat transfer mechanisms. Emphasis is placed on hands-on experience with CFD software, analyzing complex fluid flow and heat transfer phenomena, and their applications in engineering. Students will develop skills in problem-solving, simulation, and interpretation of results.
