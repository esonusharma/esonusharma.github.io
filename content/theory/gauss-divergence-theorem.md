The divergence theorem relates an integral over a volume to an integral over the surface bounding that volume. The divergence theorem states that the integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume is equal to the flux of that field through the surface bounding that volume.

$$
\int_{\mathcal V} \left( \nabla \cdot {\bf A} \right) dv = \oint_{\mathcal S} {\bf A}\cdot d{\bf s}
