By expressing the shear tensor in terms of viscosity and fluid velocity, and assuming constant density and viscosity, the Cauchy momentum equation will lead to the Navier–Stokes equations. By assuming inviscid flow, the Navier–Stokes equations can further simplify to the Euler equations.

The Cauchy equation is a fundamental equation representing the conservation of momentum in a continuum, serving as the starting point for deriving more specific fluid flow equations like the Navier-Stokes (NS) equation; while RANS (Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes) is a simplified version of the NS equation, specifically designed to analyze turbulent flows by averaging the fluctuating components of the velocity field over time
