Green’s theorem relates the line integral around a closed curve with a double integral over the region inside the curve:

$$
\int_{C} F \cdot ds = \int \int_{D} (curl F)\cdot k dA
$$

$$
\oint_C \textbf{f}\cdot d\textbf{r} = \iint\limits_R \left( \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial y} \right)dA
$$
