### Reynolds transport theorem / Reynolds theorem

Reynolds Transport theorem is a generalization of the Leibniz rule and thus the same arguments are used. The only difference is that the velocity has three components and only the perpendicular component enters into the calculations.

$$
\frac{D}{DT} \int_{sys} f \rho dV = \frac{d}{dt} \int_{c.v.} f \rho dV + \int_{S_{c.v.}}  f \rho U_{rn} dA
$$
